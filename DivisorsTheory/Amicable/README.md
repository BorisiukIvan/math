# A program that finds amicable numbers
This program finds amicable pairs with new method, that allows to find such pairs __much__ faster!
You can see the code at __main.py__, results at __results__, 

To run this program, you need to have a list of primes from _1_ to _n_. We recommend you set $n=1000000$ (use __../eratosfen.c__)
Good luck running!
