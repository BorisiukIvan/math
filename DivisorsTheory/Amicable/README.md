# A program that finds amicable numbers
This program finds amicable pairs, using a new method which allows to find such pairs __much__ faster than the simple bruteforce approach!

You can see the code at __main.py__ and some results at __results__.

To run this program, you need to have a list of primes from _1_ to _n_. We recommend you set $n=1000000$ (use __../eratosfen.c__)
